# Count Values With Equally Spaced Occurrences II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums`.

An integer `x` is called  **special**  if:

- x appears at least three times in nums.
- All occurrences of x are equally spaced in nums. In other words, if all occurrences of x are at indices i1 < i2 <... < im, then i2 - i1 = i3 - i2 =... = im - im-1.

Return the number of  **distinct**  special integers in `nums`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [1,8,1,5,1,5,8,5]

 **Output:**  2

 **Explanation:** 

- 1 is special because it occurs at equally spaced indices 0, 2, and 4.
- 5 is special because it occurs at equally spaced indices 3, 5, and 7.
- 8 is not special because it occurs only twice.

Therefore, the answer is 2.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [8,8,8,8]

 **Output:**  1

 **Explanation:** 

8 is special because it occurs at equally spaced indices 0, 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, the answer is 1.

 **Example 3:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [8,6,6,8,8]

 **Output:**  0

 **Explanation:** 

8 occurs at indices 0, 3, and 4, which are not equally spaced. 6 occurs only twice. Therefore, no integer is special.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 3 <= nums.length <= 105
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 109

                }
            }
            if(flag){
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
